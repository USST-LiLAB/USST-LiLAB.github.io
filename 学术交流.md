#### 邀请报告

##### 1. [Distributed Process Control Using Dissipativity Theory](https://lxy.usst.edu.cn/2023/0823/c6729a304218/page.htm)

- 报告人：Prof. Jie Bao, UNSW, Sydney

- Bio: **Prof. Jie Bao** is a professor at School of Chemical Engineering, UNSW. He is a Process Control expert of international repute, particularly in dissipativity/passivity-based process control. He is the Director of ARC Research Hub for Integrated Energy Storage Systems and also leads the Process Control Research Group. His research interests include dissipativity theory-based process control, networked and distributed control systems, system behavioural theory and control applications in membrane separation, flow batteries, coal preparation and Aluminium smelting. He has published extensively in major process control and chemical engineering journals. He is an Associate Editor of Journal of Process Control (an International Federation of Automatic Control affiliated journal) and Digital Chemical Engineering (an IChemE journal). He also serves on International Federation of Automatic Control Technical Committees: Chemical Process Control (TC6.1); Mining, Mineral and Metal Processing (TC6.2).
