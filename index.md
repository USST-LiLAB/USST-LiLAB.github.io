Welcome to the USST Center for multi-source data fusion and analysis (MSDFA) led by [Prof. Wangyan Li](https://lxy.usst.edu.cn/2022/0107/c2208a263867/page.htm) at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST). Our group is affiliated with the College of Science. 

## Introduction
Here is **LiLAB (多源数据融合与分析实验中心)**.
- Leader: Wangyan Li

Wangyan Li received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and automation in 2010 from Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China, and Ph.D degree in system analysis and integration from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China in 2017. Dr. Li is currently an assosicate professor at the College of Science, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. He was postdoctoral fellow with School of Chemical Engineering, UNSW, Sydney, Australia fromn August 2018 to January 2021. From August 2017 to August 2018, he was a research associate with Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. From November 2015 to January 2016, he was a research associate with the Department of Mathematics, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. He has published more than 20 papers in refereed international journals. He is also an active reviewer for many international journals. His current research interests include observability/detectability over sensor networks, plantwide fault detection and diagnosis, data-driven theory, and dissipativity theory.
